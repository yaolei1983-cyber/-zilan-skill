## Local Validation

After changing `SKILL.md`, `agents/`, `context/`, the Agama corpus, or scripts, run at least:

```bash
python scripts/validate_zilan_repo.py --check-generated
python -m pytest
python scripts/search_agama.py --terms "無我|非我|緣起" --limit 10
```

`validate_zilan_repo.py` checks required files, the Codex regression matrix, key Agent prompt fragments, Agama search smoke tests, and optionally verifies that Markdown generated from CBETA XML is stable.

## Knowledge Co-Building

This skill is a living learning system. Core knowledge is maintained in:
- `SKILL.md` — Main definition file
- `context/摄类学工具箱.md` — Conceptual analysis & logical reasoning toolkit
- `context/因明推理引擎.md` — Buddhist logic engine
- `沟通过程.md` — Evolution trail
