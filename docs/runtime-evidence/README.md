# Runtime Evidence Excerpts

> Last updated: 2026-06-15

This directory stores small, redacted validation excerpts that support entries in `docs/runtime-validation-log.md`.

Use this directory for:

- command-output excerpts from clean install or CI-adjacent smoke tests
- short transcript excerpts that demonstrate a specific platform behavior
- redacted live-provider response summaries
- generated report file summaries when the full report is too large or private

Do not use this directory for:

- API keys, tokens, cookies, or account metadata
- raw provider payloads with private request IDs or account identifiers
- large unredacted transcripts
- private user content unrelated to a validation case

## Naming

Use dated, route-specific filenames:

```text
YYYY-MM-DD-route-or-scenario.md
```

Examples:

- `2026-06-15-clean-install-smoke.md`
- `2026-06-XX-openai-api-zc-02-live.md`
- `2026-06-XX-claude-code-zc-04-excerpt.md`

## Required Fields

Each evidence excerpt should include:

- date
- repository commit
- route or scenario
- command or prompt set
- redaction note
- compact output excerpts
- limitations
- link back to the relevant `docs/runtime-validation-log.md` entry

Use `docs/validation-evidence.md` as the governing policy.
